# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to determine if there is a discernable difference between paid and unpaid video game reviews. It is important for Vine and Google to understand if paid reviewers are biased toward giving games they reviewed a consistently more positive (or negative) review than non-Vine reviewers who are not being paid. This bias could undermine the accuracy of the Vine platform and, ultimately, cause it to become untrusted and unused by consumers. This knowledge will allow Vine to figure out a way to incentive paid reviewers for their efforts so as to not distort the usefulness of their analysis.

## Summary

We can say with a fairly high degree of certainty given the information available that there is a bias among paid Vine reviewers towards giving five-stars to video games they review. This is because paid Vine reviewers  rate 51.06% of video games as 5 stars versus only 38.7% of unpaid, non-Vine reviewers. 

We should exercise a bit of caution though as the small number of paid Vine reviewers (94) represent less than .2% of the much larger group of non-Vine and unpaid users (40,471). One might be able to argue that the smaller number of paid reviewers are actually more discerning and methodical in their evaluation of video games than a non-paid and presumably recreational player might be and this results in a more balanced analysis. I would want to run an analysis to see where the majority of non-Vine user's reviews land. If a large number are 1 or 2 stars, then it might be a case where they are "tolling" the review system in order to make games that they don't like (or maybe they don't even play) look less appealing. More analysis would be warranted before coming to a final determination.
